Welcome to HatsPil!

HatsPil is a a Python pipeline for High-Throughput Sequencing analysis.
It has been designed to be used inside our laboratory, the Salvatore Oliviero
lab within the HuGef institute, TO (IT). Whoever find it useful or a good
starting point to develop his own pipeline is encouraged to use and hack the
code.

As for any Python package, use the setup.py script to build and install
the package inside your system. Python 3 is required.

One of the most important file is the config.ini. It can be obtained passing
only '--configout config.ini' to the program, and it is recommended to modify
the resulting file. The program will scan for a file with this name in the
current directory, otherwise it must be specified explicitly with the "-c"
parameter.
